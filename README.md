Code against Climate Change

üî•üåè Code against Climate Change is a curated list of tech projects against climate change - hoping to inspire disruptive technological climate action!

Climate change is the biggest threat of our generation. Emissions are rising and according to the newest IPCC report, we are heading towards an unprecedented disaster. Political outrage is slowly forming but we also need technological disruptions! This living list aims to educate hackers and developers on promising tech projects against climate change, hoping to inspire immediate and disruptive technological climate action!

üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Movements

    Extinction Rebellion main repo of the movement for mass direct action of non violent civil disobedience to declare the state of climate emergency.

    Fridays for Future movement of school kids around the world striking for the climate every Friday following Greta Thunberg's lead.

üìà Data and Metrics

    Project Drawdown maps out causes and 100 solutions to global warming. The structure of this list is inspired by Project Drawdown. [TED Talk]
    Global Carbon Atlas is a platform to explore and visualize the most up-to-date data on carbon fluxes resulting from human activities and natural processes.
    Climate Impact Lab is a collaboration of 30 climate scientists, economists, computational experts, researchers, analysts, and students from the US providing insights into climate change.
    The Gold Standard manages best practice standards for climate and sustainable development interventions to maximise impact.

üîå Energy

    Electricity Generation accounts for around 40 percent of all emissions to the atmosphere, making it the highest-emitting sector in the world.
    Fossil fuels represent 67 percent, nuclear 11 percent, and renewable energy sources just over 24 percent (and growing) of total worldwide electricity generation.

Solutions: In the last few years, the competitiveness of renewable sources for electricity generation has continued to increase due to the price evolution and the efficiency improvements of these technologies.

    Azuri provides a pay-as-you-go solar home system in Africa with eight hours of emission-free lighting each day and enough power to charge mobile phones.
    Stanford's solar-powered pumps are helping farmers in rural Benin irrigate dry land.
    Sol Share provides a peer-to-peer electricity trading network for rural households with and without solar home systems in Shariatpur, Bangladesh. People in rural Bangladesh are now earning additional income by selling their surplus electricity while new users have gained access to electricity without a centralized grid. [UNFCCC summary]
    Google's Project Sunroof leverages high-resolution aerial imagery from Google Earth to help calculate a roof‚Äôs solar energy potential. It enables tens of millions of potential solar customers from across the U.S. to evaluate if their home is suitable for solar and how much they could save on electricity. [UNFCCC summary]

üåæ Food

    Crop and livestock production is the source of about 12 percent all emissions.
    Land clearing (which is mostly for agriculture) is the source of another 12 percent of all emissions (IPCC, 2014).

Solutions: Supply-side agricultural solutions (e.g. precision agriculture) reduce emissions from farming. Demand-side solutions (e.g plant-based diet and reduced food waste) reduce the need for land clearing.

    Microsoft's FarmBeats enables data-driven farming by leveraging local sensors, drones and satellite images and AI to create heatmaps for farmers to optimize their crop production.
    Foodsharing.de is a free foodsharing web platform, allowing participants to share food and reduce food waste.
    FHI360 collects, analyzes and sends out agricultural advisories, crop and livestock market information and weather data to Ugandan farmers, who are among the most affected by the impacts of climate change. As a result, farmers are able to minimize crop loss and damage, making them more resilient to global warming.
    ICTs For Small-Scale Farmers in Colombia and Honduras leverages sensors and tools that collects, collates, and analyzes weather data to inform farmers in advance on how to adjust their agricultural practices to ensure maximum crop-yield and thus food security.

üå≤ Land Use

    Deforestation and degradation of forest ecosystems are responsible for about 10-15 percent of all emissions today.

Solutions: Land use solutions reduce emissions from deforestation and degradation of ecosystems.

    GainForest provides AI-powered conservation tools for deforestation analysis and forecasting.
    Rainforest Connection creates acoustic monitoring systems to detect and end illegal deforestation in real-time.
    Ekofolio is a platform powered by blockchain technology, allowing anyone to invest in timberland.

    Ericson's Connected Mangrove combines cloud, machine-to-machine and mobile broadband to help the local community in Selangor, Malaysia, to better manage the growth of new mangrove saplings.

üè† Buildings and Cities

    Dense urban human settlement account for a significant percentage of human energy use, mostly for heating and cooling, responsible for 6 percent of all emissions

Solutions: Addressing the operating inefficiencies of dwelling in and using buildings, and of living in cities.

    Self-Sufficient House is a concept house in Switzerland that is off-grid and produces its own energy
    ETH's Future Cities Lab investigates sustainable solutions for city planning

üöó Transport

    Transport produces 14 percent of all emissions.

Solutions: Some modes of transport can only currently be made more efficient at using existing fossil fuels, others have alternative fuels and/or can be avoided completely using information and communication technologies.

    Tesla is one of the world's most valuable car producers. It pioneered consumer-friendly electric cars, disrupting the diesel-powered traditional car industry.
    ChargePoint is the world‚Äôs largest electric vehicle (EV) charging network. Its smart-energy management solutions help people and businesses shift from fueling with gasoline to fueling with electricity. [UNFCCC Summary]

‚ôª Materials

    There is significant greenhouse gas emissions throughout the life cycle of the products that meet our daily needs.
    Linear life cycle where material is extracted, processed, transported, manufactured, utilized, and discarded leaves a terrific atmospheric and financial footprint from the energy wasted.

Solutions: Redesigning and reimagining the materials used in products and structures, as well as the means by which they can be reduced, reused, and recycled.

    FairPhone in Netherlands is making ‚Äúfair‚Äù phones, opening up the supply chain and seeking to make a positive impact in the industries involved like mining, design, and manufacturing.
    Green Credit Cards from the Korean Ministry of Environment encourages users to make low-carbon lifestyle choices. More than 15 million cards have been issued in South Korea.

üîÆ Emerging Solutions

Solutions: Technologies and solutions that do not yet have enough scientific and financial information to model, but that could emerge within the next several years as game-changers in the effort to reverse global warming.

    Self-Driving Cars

üåç Climate Change and Society

    Global warming already has societal impacts such as climate migrations and travel risks
    Due to existing inequalities, women and girls are disproportionately vulnerable to its impacts, from disease to natural disaster.

Solutions: Analyze its societal impact to understand policy changes

    Global Policy Lab uses 1.6 million historical aerial photographs to discern the effect of major droughts and climate change on human migration in Africa.
    SmartICE is a climate change adaptation tool that integrates traditional knowledge of sea ice with advanced data acquisition and remote monitoring technology, aiding Inuits in the planning of safe routes on the ice, thus reducing travel risks. [Guardian]
    CREA Mont-Blanc leverages webcams, citizen science and automated the monitoring of temperatures, snow patterns, and behaviors of the fauna and flora in the Mont-Blanc area to inform on land-use strategies in the mountains. [UNFCCC summary]

[[UNFCCC summary](https://unfccc.int/climate-action/momentum-for-change/ict-solutions/solshare)]
- [Google's Project Sunroof](https://www.google.com/get/sunroof) leverages high-resolution aerial imagery from Google Earth to help calculate a roof‚Äôs solar energy potential. It enables tens of millions of potential solar customers from across the U.S. to evaluate if their home is suitable for solar and how much they could save on electricity. [[UNFCCC summary](https://unfccc.int/climate-action/momentum-for-change/ict-solutions/project-sunroof)]

## üåæ Food 

- Crop and livestock production is the source of about **12 percent all emissions**.
- Land clearing (which is mostly for agriculture) is the source of **another 12 percent of all emissions** ([IPCC, 2014](https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg3/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter11.pdf)).

**Solutions:** Supply-side agricultural solutions (e.g. precision agriculture) reduce emissions from farming. Demand-side solutions (e.g plant-based diet and reduced food waste) reduce the need for land clearing.

- [Microsoft's FarmBeats](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai-for-earth/farmbeats) enables data-driven farming by leveraging local sensors, drones and satellite images and AI to create heatmaps for farmers to optimize their crop production.
- [Foodsharing.de](https://foodsharing.de/) is a free foodsharing web platform, allowing participants to share food and reduce food waste.
- [FHI360](https://www.fhi360.org/practice-areas/technology) collects, analyzes and sends out agricultural advisories, crop and livestock market information and weather data to Ugandan farmers, who are among the most affected by the impacts of climate change. As a result, farmers are able to minimize crop loss and damage, making them more resilient to global warming.
- [ICTs For Small-Scale Farmers](https://unfccc.int/climate-action/momentum-for-change/ict-solutions/icts-for-small-scale-farmers-a-game-changing-approach-to-climate-smart-agriculture-in-latin-america) in Colombia and Honduras
leverages sensors and tools that collects, collates, and analyzes weather data to inform farmers in advance on how to adjust their agricultural practices to ensure maximum crop-yield and thus food security.

## üå≤ Land Use 

- Deforestation and degradation of forest ecosystems are responsible for about **10-15 percent of all emissions** today. 

**Solutions:** Land use solutions reduce emissions from deforestation and degradation of ecosystems. 

- [GainForest](http://gainforest.org/) provides AI-powered conservation tools for deforestation analysis and forecasting.
- [Rainforest Connection](https://rfcx.org/) creates acoustic monitoring systems to detect and end illegal deforestation in real-time.

## üè† Buildings and Cities 

- Dense urban human settlement account for a significant percentage of human energy use, mostly for heating and cooling, responsible for **6 percent of all emissions**

**Solutions:** Addressing the operating inefficiencies of dwelling in and using buildings, and of living in cities.

- [Self-Sufficient House](https://houseofswitzerland.org/node/1188/house-provides-its-own-energy) is a concept house in Switzerland that is off-grid and produces its own energy 
- [ETH's Future Cities Lab](http://www.fcl.ethz.ch/) investigates sustainable solutions for city planning

## üöó Transport 

- Transport produces **14 percent of all emissions**. 

**Solutions:** Some modes of transport can only currently be made more efficient at using existing fossil fuels, others have alternative fuels and/or can be avoided completely using information and communication technologies.

- [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) is one of the world's most valuable car producers. It pioneered consumer-friendly electric cars, disrupting the diesel-powered traditional car industry.
- [ChargePoint](https://www.chargepoint.com/) is the world‚Äôs largest electric vehicle (EV) charging network. Its smart-energy management solutions help people and businesses shift from fueling with gasoline to fueling with electricity. [[UNFCCC Summary](https://unfccc.int/climate-action/momentum-for-change/ict-solutions/chargepoint-electric-vehicle-charging-corridors)]

## ‚ôª Materials 

- There is significant greenhouse gas emissions throughout the life cycle of the products that meet our daily needs. 
- Linear life cycle where material is extracted, processed, transported, manufactured, utilized, and discarded leaves a terrific atmospheric and financial footprint from the energy wasted.

**Solutions:** Redesigning and reimagining the materials used in products and structures, as well as the means by which they can be reduced, reused, and recycled.

However, if you prefer simplicity and quicker setup, go with:

üëâ JavaScript ‚úÖ (easier for beginners and faster to set up)

If you also want optimized performance, you can choose TypeScript + SWC or JavaScript + SWC, as SWC is a Rust-based compiler that makes the build process faster.

For routing, we can later install React Router manually with:

-	Climate Action Hub 
-	Climate Refugee (We are creating a dynamic website featuring a 3D Earth visualization to represent climate refugees from around the world. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive platform that not only visualizes the global impact of climate displacement but also offers crucial support to those affected. Climate refugees are individuals forced to flee their homes due to the impacts of climate change, such as rising sea levels, droughts, and extreme weather events. These displaced populations often face significant challenges, including loss of livelihood, lack of access to basic services, and insecure living conditions. Unlike political refugees, climate refugees do not yet have legal protections under international law, making their situation more precarious. As climate change intensifies, the number of people displaced by environmental factors is expected to rise, highlighting the urgent need for global cooperation and sustainable solutions to address this growing crisis.
Workflow: Enter Co ordinates and it will display data of displaced people on globe [prototype] and having some story as a card pop up )

Plastic pollution is a growing crisis in South Asia‚Äôs rivers, seas, and coastal areas, with 
devastating effects on marine ecosystems, local communities, and economies. Millions of 
tons of plastic waste enter water bodies every year, harming coral reefs, marine species, and 
human livelihoods. 
Scope of the Problem 
‚Ä¢ Plastic waste flows from rivers into oceans, accumulating in fragile ecosystems like 
coral reefs and coastal fisheries. 
‚Ä¢ Deep-sea plastic pollution is poorly monitored, making it difficult to track and remove 
waste. 
‚Ä¢ Lack of real-time detection systems and data prevents governments and 
conservation groups from taking timely action. 
‚Ä¢ Limited public awareness leads to continued plastic dumping into water bodies. 
Who It Affects 
‚Ä¢ Marine Life: Plastic entangles or is ingested by fish, sea turtles, and other marine 
animals, leading to injuries and death. 
‚Ä¢ Coastal Communities & Fishermen: Plastic pollution reduces fish populations, directly 
impacting livelihoods. 
‚Ä¢ Tourism Industry: Polluted beaches and oceans discourage eco-tourism, affecting local 
economies. 
‚Ä¢ Governments & Conservation Groups: Without real-time tracking, authorities struggle 
to clean and prevent plastic waste. 
Environmental & Social Impact 
‚Ä¢ Biodiversity Loss: Plastic kills marine life and damages coral reefs, which are vital for 
ocean health. 
‚Ä¢ Microplastic Contamination: Plastic breaks down into tiny pieces that enter the food 
chain, harming human health. 
‚Ä¢ Economic Damage: Reduced fishing, declining tourism, and increased cleanup costs 
burden governments and communities. 
2. What inovative solution are you proposing? 
To address plastic pollution in rivers and seas, we propose AquaGuardAI, an AI-based system 
that detects, tracks, and analyzes plastic waste in deep water. Unlike traditional manual 
cleanup efforts, AquaGuardAI uses underwater drones, AI-powered cameras, and real-time 
data analytics to provide a scalable and efficient solution. 
How It Works: 
1
 Ô∏è Underwater Plastic Detection: 
‚Ä¢ Drones with cameras and sensors scan the ocean floor and riverbeds for plastic waste. 
‚Ä¢ AI-powered computer vision models analyze and classify plastic debris. 
‚Ä¢ Multiple AI models work together to improve accuracy, even in murky waters. 
2
 Ô∏è Real-Time Monitoring & Prediction: 
‚Ä¢ A live dashboard provides real-time pollution maps for governments & NGOs. 
‚Ä¢ Heatmaps show high-risk areas, helping organizations focus cleanup efforts. 
‚Ä¢ AI predicts future plastic accumulation trends, enabling preventive action. 
3
 Ô∏è Community Engagement & Awareness: 
‚Ä¢ A mobile app allows fishermen and volunteers to report plastic hotspots. 
‚Ä¢ An AI chatbot educates users on plastic reduction and responsible waste disposal. 
Why This is Innovative & Scalable 
First AI-powered deep-sea plastic detection system focused on rivers & oceans. 
Scalable ‚Äì can be expanded to different water bodies across South Asia. 
Integrates community engagement, AI automation, and real-time monitoring for maximum 
impact.

3. Climate Assistant (Chatbot [using together.ai Open source LLMs])

4. Idea Proposal [Plasting Detection in Deep Sea, Protecting Coral Reef & Aqua Life]

Plastic pollution is a growing crisis in South Asia‚Äôs rivers, seas, and coastal areas, with 
devastating effects on marine ecosystems, local communities, and economies. Millions of 
tons of plastic waste enter water bodies every year, harming coral reefs, marine species, and 
human livelihoods. 
Scope of the Problem 
‚Ä¢ Plastic waste flows from rivers into oceans, accumulating in fragile ecosystems like 
coral reefs and coastal fisheries. 
‚Ä¢ Deep-sea plastic pollution is poorly monitored, making it difficult to track and remove 
waste. 
‚Ä¢ Lack of real-time detection systems and data prevents governments and 
conservation groups from taking timely action. 
‚Ä¢ Limited public awareness leads to continued plastic dumping into water bodies. 
Who It Affects 
‚Ä¢ Marine Life: Plastic entangles or is ingested by fish, sea turtles, and other marine 
animals, leading to injuries and death. 
‚Ä¢ Coastal Communities & Fishermen: Plastic pollution reduces fish populations, directly 
impacting livelihoods. 
‚Ä¢ Tourism Industry: Polluted beaches and oceans discourage eco-tourism, affecting local 
economies. 
‚Ä¢ Governments & Conservation Groups: Without real-time tracking, authorities struggle 
to clean and prevent plastic waste. 
Environmental & Social Impact 
‚Ä¢ Biodiversity Loss: Plastic kills marine life and damages coral reefs, which are vital for 
ocean health. 
‚Ä¢ Microplastic Contamination: Plastic breaks down into tiny pieces that enter the food 
chain, harming human health. 
‚Ä¢ Economic Damage: Reduced fishing, declining tourism, and increased cleanup costs 
burden governments and communities. 
2. What inovative solution are you proposing? 
To address plastic pollution in rivers and seas, we propose Climate Assistant, an AI-based system 
that detects, tracks, and analyzes plastic waste in deep water. Unlike traditional manual 
cleanup efforts, Climate Assistant uses underwater drones, AI-powered cameras, and real-time 
data analytics to provide a scalable and efficient solution. 
How It Works: 
1
 Ô∏è Underwater Plastic Detection: 
‚Ä¢ Drones with cameras and sensors scan the ocean floor and riverbeds for plastic waste. 
‚Ä¢ AI-powered computer vision models analyze and classify plastic debris. 
‚Ä¢ Multiple AI models work together to improve accuracy, even in murky waters. 
2
 Ô∏è Real-Time Monitoring & Prediction: 
‚Ä¢ A live dashboard provides real-time pollution maps for governments & NGOs. 
‚Ä¢ Heatmaps show high-risk areas, helping organizations focus cleanup efforts. 
‚Ä¢ AI predicts future plastic accumulation trends, enabling preventive action. 
3
 Ô∏è Community Engagement & Awareness: 
‚Ä¢ A mobile app allows fishermen and volunteers to report plastic hotspots. 
‚Ä¢ An AI chatbot educates users on plastic reduction and responsible waste disposal. 
Why This is Innovative & Scalable 
First AI-powered deep-sea plastic detection system focused on rivers & oceans. 
Scalable ‚Äì can be expanded to different water bodies across South Asia.

SCHEDULING NOTES:

Our opening ceremony is on Friday, February 21st @ 9 pm EST...Should be a great event, with some incredible guest speakers joining. Will share key context/ background/ guidance for the hackathon. BONUS POINTS for teams that do come. Highly encourage all to make it.
Links will be sent via a Calendar invite using Zoom, please RSVP if you are able to come. 
We also have a SUPER line-up of workshops & other events. It is 100% okay to register for only for the workshops. Stay tuned for updates.
Final submission is a 4-MINUTE PITCH VIDEO (detailed guidance on this will be provided on rubrix + structure), due on Sunday, February 23 @ 11:59 PM EST.
 

About the Challenge:
Climate change is among the most urgent issues of our time.

2011-20 was the Earth's warmest decade in recorded history, and up to one million species are at risk of extinction due to climate change. Tens of millions will be displaced from their homes because of it. The Climate Action Tracker anticipates a 4 degrees increase in global temperatures by 2100 if we keep at our current trajectories... The delicate balance that we have on Earth is at risk.

So, what do we do about it? The need for action & innovation is more urgent than ever. And to make headway in addressing the problem, it will not be a "magic bullet" that solves everything, but rather the joint efforts of engineers, artists, coders, educators, politicians, business-people & others coordinating with a variety of different solutions to make a difference.

 

Our challenge: Can you create that next big solution to our climate change dilemma?
It can be locally-focused, it can be globally-minded. It can be an art concept, a new machine, a code-heavy app, a proposal for an event, a plan to conserve an ecosystem, an education campaign or more. It can be a business, a non-profit concept or anything in between. It can be many things. As long as it's built with the planet and its people in mind, working to address the climate crisis in its own unique way.

 

The Logistics:
Our opening ceremony is at 9 pm EST, Friday, February 21, with our deadline set at 11:59 PM EST on Sunday, February, 23. Folks may work on their ideas at any point from during that weekend.
We do ask that you submit original ideas, which means that the ideas must not have been submitted in their current form to past hackathons or similar innovation competitions... if you are thinking of evolving a past idea in a significant way, let us know & can advise if it'll be different enough to submit here.
Each team should have 2-5 members, which can come pre-formed or be finalized before/ during the hackathon with help of the organizers... In terms of helping with team formation, we will have a Slack channel TBA & also do a match-making event the Friday before for folks looking for teams/ teammates.
Be sure to check eligibility requirements as you make your team... Having a diverse set of people & backgrounds‚Äî including in the level of past hackathon experience‚Äî will be key!
During the hackathon, there will be opportunities to attend educational workshops on different issues, some related to developing skills for developing/ presenting your idea (e.g. on pitching), and others on issues around climate change (e.g. on environmental justice)....  Although not finalized, we may have bonus points or incentives to encourage folks to take advantage of these different opportunities.
In addition, there will be information + resources + advice shared during our intro session, via our Slack and through mentors who will be available at points during the weekend.
Some details above change closer to the date.
 

A final note that the submission itself will likely be a four-minute video (may change), with finalists then being invited to present their solutions live at a finals time TBD in the weeks following.

 

Themes:
Over the course of this 48-hour hackathon, we will focus on four sets of challenges that will need to be addressed as we fight climate change. These are described below:

1. The Adaptation Challenge: From sea level rise to the increased extreme weather events, we must face a reality that some impacts of climate change are here to stay... And with that, comes a need to adapt our communities, infrastructure and processes to be more resilient to the new and ever-evolving reality we find ourselves in. What can you do to help with climate adaptation, locally or globally?

2. The Biodiversity Challenge: We cannot solve our climate crisis without also addressing our biodiversity crisis, and vice versa. Looking at things like mangrove restoration, coral reef regeneration or the protection of unique ecosystems like the Arctic, nature-based solutions offer some of the greatest potential to address the climate crisis. How can we protect biodiversity from climate change or use it to mitigate impacts?

3. The Capacity Challenge: Even as impacts of the climate crisis become more real, there exists much misinformation spread about on climate. And beyond this education piece, how to shift our workforce and activate humankind's potential to act on climate is a real question... There is a lot of work we need to do to meet our climate goals, how do we develop our capacity to do so?

4. The Technology Challenge: Much of our climate dilemma comes from using carbon-heavy technologies to address problems of the past. From changing how we transport goods to how we create electricity to how we build cities differently, there is a lot in our current technology that needs to change. And the potential of engineered carbon sinks also must be explored. How can technology be used to address the climate crisis?

 

Our Four Lens that Every Solution Must Consider
Regardless of what theme/ challenge you choose to focus on, participants should also consider the following perspectives/ lenses in designing their proposed solutions:

An Equity & Justice Lens: Think about how your solution will impact different communities, including those most impacted by climate or who have been historically marginalized from decision-making (e.g. indigenous & racialized groups). Think also about your solution's impacts on generations into the future.
A Practical Lens: Think about your timelines for action & what it will take to implement your idea. There is time pressure to act on climate, which makes it important to have those big dreams about all that can be possible (there's SO much to be hopeful for), while grounding action to the realities of the present.
A Two-Eyed Seeing Approach: Incorporate a two-eyed seeing approach, where you complement indigenous knowledge with academic science, learning from these inter-connected and unique perspectives. Additionally, ground your solution in facts, and do research on the people + issues you are seeking to serve/address.
A Systems Approach: While your idea may focus on one theme, it likely links to many others. For example, solar panels are a high-potential renewable energy source, yet rely on rare earth materials that can hurt biodiversity if mined improperly. Think about your solutions impact on all the themes.
The above "lens" are not specific to any solution but rather apply to any project concepts that one might develop. These are not necessarily things you will be asked about in your submission, yet must always be front-of-mind when creating new (or evolving old) solutions for the climate crisis!

- Give Every thing a Human Touch
- Use simple English
- Add links/resources where required
- Future Work Include
      * Climate Action Hub: can be driven by Community engagement users will have access to add resources, info morever able to do compaigns and volounteer classrooms for climate education - all can be accessed by admins and moderators Panel
      * ClimateAssistant V2.0 : use an OpenAI Assistant and the amazing Probable futures API to provide climate change information for a location, and provide some helpful resources for how to prepare.  we explore how to create a conversational AI agent using climate change data from the excellent Probable Futures API and the new OpenAI Assistants API. The AI agent is able to answer questions about how climate might affect a specified location and also perform basic data analysis. AI assistants can be well-suited to tasks like this, providing a promising channel for presenting complex data to non-technical users. For us to be able to create an AI agent to help with preparing for climate change, we need a good source of climate change data and an API to extract that information. Any such resource must apply a rigorous approach to combine General Circulation Model (GCM) predictions.

Luckily, the folks at Probable Futures have done an amazing job! Probable Futures is ‚ÄúA non-profit climate literacy initiative that makes practical tools, stories, and resources available online to everyone, everywhere.‚Äù, and they provide a series of maps and data based on the CORDEX-CORE framework, a standardization for climate model output from the REMO2015 and REGCM4 regional climate models. [ Side note: I am not affiliated with Probable Futures ]

Importantly, they provide a GraphQL API for accessing this data which I could access after requesting an API key.The AI agent can be improved through some instructions about how it presents information.

One of the instructions was to always generate a link to the map visualization back on the Probable Futures website, which when clicked goes to the right location ‚Ä¶
The agent always generates a URL to take the user to the correct map visualization for their query on the probable futures website

Another instruction asked the agent to always prompt the user to try other warming scenarios. By default, the agent produces results for a predicted 1.5C global increase in temperature, but we allow the user to explore other ‚Äî and somewhat depressing ‚Äî scenarios.
Analysis Tasks

Since we gave the AI agent the code interpreter skill, it should be able to execute Python code to do basic data analysis. Let‚Äôs try this out.

First I asked for how climate change would affect London and New York, to which the agent provided summaries. Then I asked ‚Ä¶

This resulted in the Agent using code interpreter to generate and run Python code to create a plot ‚Ä¶
The AI agent is able to carry out basic data analysis tasks using climate change data extracted from the API

       * Tracking & Aiding Climate Refugees: for now we used a downloadable data from NASA and presented a prototype , but for future it could be integrated with real-time data and Real globe/map , get more insights and statistics and user prompted queries make every thing accessible easily and connect them with nearer NGOs, Education , Resources etc {add more if required}

       * Plastic Detection in Deep-Sea  & Aiding Coral Leaf and AquaLife: For now its just an idea with a feasilbilty report, its impact and how can we overcome it with some feasibilty and market opportunity.

Keep this in whats next for Climate Nexus {keep the chatBot part V2.0 concise }

Future Work Include
      * Climate Action Hub: can be driven by Community engagement users will have access to add resources, info morever able to do compaigns and volounteer classrooms for climate education - all can be accessed by admins and moderators Panel
      * ClimateAssistant V2.0 : use an OpenAI Assistant and the amazing Probable futures API to provide climate change information for a location, and provide some helpful resources for how to prepare.  we explore how to create a conversational AI agent using climate change data from the excellent Probable Futures API and the new OpenAI Assistants API. The AI agent is able to answer questions about how climate might affect a specified location and also perform basic data analysis. AI assistants can be well-suited to tasks like this, providing a promising channel for presenting complex data to non-technical users. For us to be able to create an AI agent to help with preparing for climate change, we need a good source of climate change data and an API to extract that information. Any such resource must apply a rigorous approach to combine General Circulation Model (GCM) predictions.

Luckily, the folks at Probable Futures have done an amazing job! Probable Futures is ‚ÄúA non-profit climate literacy initiative that makes practical tools, stories, and resources available online to everyone, everywhere.‚Äù, and they provide a series of maps and data based on the CORDEX-CORE framework, a standardization for climate model output from the REMO2015 and REGCM4 regional climate models. [ Side note: I am not affiliated with Probable Futures ]

Importantly, they provide a GraphQL API for accessing this data which I could access after requesting an API key.The AI agent can be improved through some instructions about how it presents information.

One of the instructions was to always generate a link to the map visualization back on the Probable Futures website, which when clicked goes to the right location ‚Ä¶
The agent always generates a URL to take the user to the correct map visualization for their query on the probable futures website

Another instruction asked the agent to always prompt the user to try other warming scenarios. By default, the agent produces results for a predicted 1.5C global increase in temperature, but we allow the user to explore other ‚Äî and somewhat depressing ‚Äî scenarios.
Analysis Tasks

Since we gave the AI agent the code interpreter skill, it should be able to execute Python code to do basic data analysis. Let‚Äôs try this out.

First I asked for how climate change would affect London and New York, to which the agent provided summaries. Then I asked ‚Ä¶

This resulted in the Agent using code interpreter to generate and run Python code to create a plot ‚Ä¶
The AI agent is able to carry out basic data analysis tasks using climate change data extracted from the API

       * Tracking & Aiding Climate Refugees: for now we used a downloadable data from NASA and presented a prototype , but for future it could be integrated with real-time data and Real globe/map , get more insights and statistics and user prompted queries make every thing accessible easily and connect them with nearer NGOs, Education , Resources etc {add more if required}

       * Plastic Detection in Deep-Sea  & Aiding Coral Leaf and AquaLife: For now its just an idea with a feasilbilty report, its impact and how can we overcome it with some feasibilty and market opportunity.
